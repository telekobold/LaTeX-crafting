# Counting Chicks

This small document class replaces the arabic page numbers with chicks in the center of the footer of your document. Just copy the package source code file `countingchick.sty` and the file `front-facing-baby-chick_Mozilla.png` in the same directory as your LaTeX source file, type `\usepackage{countingchicks}` in the header of your file and recompile.

This is only version 0.1 of this small project, many small improvements still need to be implemented.
