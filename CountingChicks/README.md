# Counting Chicks

This small document class replaces the page numbers of your document, which usually consist of Arabic digits, with chicks, which are placed in the middle of the footer of the respective page. Just copy the package source code file `countingchicks.sty` and the file `front-facing-baby-chick_Mozilla.png` in the same directory as your LaTeX source file, type `\usepackage{countingchicks}` in the header of your file and recompile.

This is only version 0.1 of this small project, many small improvements still need to be implemented.
